Trainleave

Trainleave is an implementation of Unicode on uxn/varvara. Currently
it can be said to be in the "technology demonstrator" stage. That
would be pre-alpha. It is able to render UTF-8 onto the screen. It
uses the GNU Unifont font and has good or decent support for many of
the scripts for which that font has good support. In particular,
Arabic and South-East Asian scripts are not well supported. Trainleave
currently doesn't have support for bidirectional scripts, like Arabic
or Hebrew, or vertical scripts like Mongolian. Trainleave only renders
the text, it has no provisions for scrolling throught the text nor
editing text.

# Building

No automated build system is provided, and none are expected to be
provided even when the software is finished. Instead, a numbered list
of easy-to-follow instructions is provided.

## Requirements for building

1. Internet connection, for downloading assets
2. Ruby, for running code generators
3. Uxn

## Instructions

1. Check out the code, obviously
2. Obtain a copy of GNU Unifont from URL 1 below and put it in the
   same directory as fontconv.rb
3. Ungzip the Unifont file
4. Obtain the Unicode Character Database from URL 2 below
5. Create the directory "UCD" in the same directory as fontconv.rb
6. Unpack the Unicode Character Database into the directory "UCD" made
   in the previous step. If successful, you should have the file
   "UCD/LineBreak.txt"
7. Create the directory "db" in the same directory fontconv.rb is
8. Run fontconv.rb with Ruby
9. Assemble unikod-renderer.tal with uxnasm

Steps 1 through 7 have to be done once only. Step 8 needs to be done
if changing the generators written in Ruby. Step 9 needs to be done if
changing Tal. Be aware that generators from step 8 also create some
Tal files.

## URLs for assets

1. http://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont/unifont-15.0.01/font-builds/unifont-15.0.01.bdf.gz
2. https://www.unicode.org/Public/zipped/15.0.0/UCD.zip

# Running

Ensure the "db" directory from the step 7 is present in your current
directory. This "db" directory holds the prepared font and Unicode
character database. Then run the rom. As it runs, either type in the
screen, or better copy and paste your text into the standard input of
the interpreter.

To enable the line-breaking algorithm, Trainleave holds the last
codepoint entered until at least one more codepoint gets entered. In
addition, rendering of text is witheld until the line-breaking
algorithm can determine nearby break points. In principle, sending
already composed text into the standard input and pressing "enter" ~2
times, to flush the buffer, works best. A subroutine for flushing the
buffers at the end of text is implemented, but unused.

# Hacking

Just dive into the code.

# Future

The author is decided to continue expanding this software until it is
able to handle all of Unicode, using outline fonts (TrueType and the
like). Support for any particular script's quirks is not guaranteed
due to the extensive amount of intimate knowledge required - but will
be attempted eventually. The ultimate goal for this particular project
is to be available as a library that can be included in your project
(the author presupposes source code inclusion due to platform
limitations).

Expected time for completion of mayor work is 2024-01-01. Success is
not guaranteed.
